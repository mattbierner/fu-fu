# FU: Future You

Future you. Pfft! What an asshole! Think they're better than you; putting on frills and getting promoted and running for office and such hifalut'n foolishness. Well we'll show 'em!

Introducing *FU: Future You*, a [great new site](https://mattbierner.github.io/fu-fu) that lets present you launch the social equivalent of guided missiles at future you, ones that explode when future you least expects into a hot rain of tears, dashed hopes, and crushed dreams and leaves future you stammering, "sorry, so sorry! It was just a joke and I've changed but I'm so, so deeply sorry."
